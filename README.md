# Clothing Store/Label eCommerce App

## A React + Redux based portfolio project

This app utilizes a custom express backend which I also created

I'm hoping to efficiently use Redux state and keep my DB touches conservative. I also want to correctly use presentational and container components correctly. Hopefully that will make creating re-usable components easier.
